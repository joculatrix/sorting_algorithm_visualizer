This was a small project to get more familiar with Ratatui, and as a fun mental exercise. Rather than implement any asynchronicity,
I had to heavily adapt the sorting algorithms so that one step of the process could be queried at a time so that it could be called
each frame from within the UI loop. I may add more sorting algorithms in the future -- or, if anyone else sees this and is interested
in doing so, it would be good practice!
